# Asteroids
In the CMPT 202, Data Structures class, February 2022 - April 2022. My project was to create Asteroids game. It was very exciting way to improve my skills in java. The gameplay consists of the player steering a triangular spaceship, with the goal of destroying asteroids by shooting them. The game has multiple parts as creating the ship, making it turn and move around the game window, creating asteroids that are moving and keep coming to the screen, The collision between the ship and an asteroid, shooting the asteroids and adding points. This project helped me to develop effective problem solving skills in java and also get better understanding of coding in general.
